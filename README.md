## Color guessing game - Work In Progress 
The project's goal is to buid a new multiplayer game from a Tic Tac Toe Starter Kit (see details about the starter kit code below) 


### Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe

This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer tic tac toe game. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.
